    <h2> Reflection </h2>
  <p7> I made my font bigger and keep it as simple as possible.
    <br>
    I liked how my other peers used different colors and fonts to make their page look pretty. Some of the pages were really organized and I loved reading all the contents.
    <br>
    Overall, I am proud that I am learing html because it allows me to do really cool stuffs. Specially, I liked learning how to add links and images to my webpage. </p7>
